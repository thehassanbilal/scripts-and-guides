# MongoDB Replica Set Setup Guide

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up a MongoDB replica set on a single machine. Each MongoDB instance will run on a separate port and be configured as part of a replica set to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the setup process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **MongoDB Installed**: Version 7.0.14 or higher.
- **Root/Sudo Access**: Required to manage MongoDB services, files, and directories.
- **Basic Knowledge of MongoDB and Linux Commands**: This guide assumes a basic understanding of MongoDB and Linux.

---

## System Preparation

### 1. Ensure No MongoDB Instances are Running

It is crucial to stop any existing MongoDB service instances to avoid port conflicts during setup. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mongod
```

### 2. Clean Up Previous Data (Optional)

If you're setting up a fresh replica set and have existing MongoDB data, you might want to clean up the previous data files. **Warning**: This will delete all existing MongoDB data.

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mongodb*
```

---

## MongoDB Configuration

Each MongoDB instance in the replica set needs its own configuration file. You will configure three instances:

- **Primary instance**: `/etc/mongod.conf`
- **Secondary instance 1**: `/etc/mongod2.conf`
- **Secondary instance 2**: `/etc/mongod3.conf`

### Example Configuration for Secondary Instance 1 (`/etc/mongod2.conf`):

```yaml
# mongod2.conf

storage:
  dbPath: /var/lib/mongodb2
  journal:
    enabled: true

systemLog:
  destination: file
  path: /var/log/mongodb/mongod2.log
  logAppend: true

net:
  port: 27018
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1

replication:
  replSetName: rs0
```

> Repeat the configuration for the second secondary instance (`mongod3.conf`), changing the port to `27019` and updating paths accordingly.

### Key Configuration Elements:

- **storage.dbPath**: Directory where MongoDB will store data. Ensure unique directories for each instance.
- **systemLog.path**: Log file location. Ensure unique logs for each instance.
- **net.port**: Unique port for each instance. MongoDB instances in the replica set should run on separate ports.
- **replication.replSetName**: The name of the replica set. Ensure the same name across all instances.

---

## Starting MongoDB Instances

Each MongoDB instance will run with its own configuration file. These instances will be configured as part of a replica set.

### 1. Start Primary Instance:

```bash
sudo mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf --fork
```

### 2. Start Secondary Instance 1:

```bash
sudo mongod --config /etc/mongod2.conf --fork
```

### 3. Start Secondary Instance 2:

```bash
sudo mongod --config /etc/mongod3.conf --fork
```

> **Note**: The `--fork` flag ensures that the MongoDB instances run as background processes.

---

## Initializing the Replica Set

Once all instances are running, connect to the **Primary** instance and initiate the replica set.

### 1. Connect to MongoDB Shell:

```bash
mongosh
```

### 2. Initiate the Replica Set:

In the MongoDB shell, run the following command to initialize the replica set:

```javascript
rs.initiate({
  _id: "rs0",
  members: [
    { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" },
    { _id: 1, host: "localhost:27018" },
    { _id: 2, host: "localhost:27019" }
  ]
})
```

> This command configures the replica set with three members: one primary and two secondaries.

---

## Verifying the Replica Set

After initiating the replica set, verify that the nodes are properly configured and the replica set is functioning correctly.

### 1. Check the Replica Set Status:

In the MongoDB shell, run:

```javascript
rs.status()
```

This will display the current status of the replica set. You should see one **PRIMARY** and two **SECONDARY** nodes.

---

## Security and Authentication (Optional)

To enhance the security of your MongoDB replica set, you can enable authentication and configure user roles.

### 1. Enable Authentication:

Edit each MongoDB configuration file (e.g., `/etc/mongod.conf`) and add the following line under `security`:

```yaml
security:
  authorization: "enabled"
```

### 2. Create an Admin User:

1. Connect to the **Primary** instance:

   ```bash
   mongosh --host localhost --port 27017
   ```

2. Switch to the `admin` database and create a user with root privileges:

   ```javascript
   use admin
   db.createUser({
     user: "admin",
     pwd: "yourpassword",
     roles: [{ role: "root", db: "admin" }]
   })
   ```

3. Restart MongoDB instances for the changes to take effect.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `Permission Denied` for WiredTiger Files

If MongoDB fails to start and you see errors like:

```
WiredTiger error message: permission denied
```

Ensure that the MongoDB process has the correct permissions for the data directories:

```bash
sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb /var/lib/mongodb2 /var/lib/mongodb3
```

### Error: `Failed to Unlink Socket File`

If you encounter an error like:

```
Failed to unlink socket file /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
```

1. Remove the socket file manually:

   ```bash
   sudo rm /tmp/mongodb-*.sock
   ```

2. Restart MongoDB instances.

---

## Stopping the Replica Set

To shut down the MongoDB replica set gracefully, stop each instance, starting with the secondary nodes.

### 1. Stop Secondary Instances:

```bash
sudo pkill -f mongod
```

### 2. Stop the Primary Instance:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mongod
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a MongoDB replica set on a single machine. This setup ensures high availability and fault tolerance for your MongoDB deployment. Keep this guide for future reference and updates, as the steps can be adapted for more complex configurations, including multi-node replica sets across different machines.

---

## Future Updates

- **Version Upgrades**: Always check the MongoDB release notes for changes to the configuration format and features.
- **Security**: Consider enabling additional security features such as SSL encryption and IP binding.
- **Scaling**: As your application grows, you may wish to scale the replica set by adding additional members or transitioning to a sharded cluster.
